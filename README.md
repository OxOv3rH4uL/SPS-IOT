# IoT Device Setup Package

**Important ^_^**

This package is currently in development and supports Temperature Sensors.

**Overview**

The IoT Device Setup Package facilitates the setup of IoT devices, storing their data in MongoDB for later visualization. Currently, it supports Temperature Sensors.

## Tech Stack

- **Front End:** PyQt5
- **Back End:** RaspberryPi, AWS (S3), MongoDB

## How It Works

The package provides a user interface using PyQt5 on the front end, allowing users to input information about the IoT device, such as equipment name, type, and sensor details.

The back end is implemented on RaspberryPi and utilizes AWS S3 for storing scripts related to the sensors. MongoDB is used to store data generated by the IoT devices.

## Usage

1. **Run the Package:** Execute the package using Python.
   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

2. **Input Information:**
   - Provide equipment information.
   - Specify the equipment type.
   - Choose the type of sensor (currently supports Temperature).
   - Enter sensor-specific details.

3. **Submit Information:**
   - Click the "Submit" button to initiate the setup process.

4. **Generated Links:**
   - After submission, the package generates links to relevant scripts and instructions.

## Future Works

- Expand script support for various sensors.
- Develop Bash scripts for additional sensor types.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionality of this IoT Device Setup Package! ^_^
